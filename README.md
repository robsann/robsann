<h1 align="center"><code>Cyber Security Homelabs</code></h1>

I've been exploring some homelabs described in YouTube channels and blogs on topics such as threat hunting (XDR), endpoint security (EDR), monitoring (SIEM), and network security (IDS/IPS)

## üìÅ Threat Hunting with Elastic Stack 8 (XDR)
- Configured in VirtualBox an Internal Network with:
    - DHCP Server
    - Ubuntu Server (Elastic Host)
    - Windows 10 (Victim)
- Configured Elastic Stack 8 on Ubuntu Server:
    - Elastic Stack: Elasticsearch, Kibana (UI), and Elastic Agent + Integrations.
    - Integrations: Fleet Server, System, Windows, and Elastic Defend.
- Simulated two malicious tests on the Victim machine:
    - EICAR Malware Test.
    - MITRE ATT&CK Test with Red Team Automation (RTA).

**Source:** https://github.com/robsann/ElasticStackLab
   
## üìÅ Detection & Response with LimaCharlie (EDR)
- Configured in VirtualBox a NAT Network with:
    - DHCP Server and Host Gateway access.
    - Windows 11 (Target) with Windows Defender disabled, Sysmon and LimaCharlie sensor installed.
    - Ubuntu Server (Attack) with Sliver installed, a Command & Control (C2) framework by BishopFox.
- Generated in Sliver a C2 payload and executed the payload on the Target machine to start a Sliver C2 session on the Attack machine.
- Used the Sliver C2 session to perform two attacks on the Target machine:
    - LSASS access (credential-stealing attack).
    - Volume shadow copies deletion using vssadmin Windows utility (used in ransomware attacks).
- Detection and response rules were created in the LimaCharlie platform to detect the two previous attacks and take action. The rules were tested by repeating the attacks.

**Source:** https://github.com/robsann/LimaCharlieEDRTelemetry
   
## üìÅ Attack Monitoring with Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)
- Microsoft Sentinel was used to monitor failed RDP login attempts from global attackers on an exposed Windows 10 virtual machine configured in Microsoft Azure.
- A custom log file (`failed_rdp.log`) was generated using a PowerShell script that extracts failed login events from Security Log on Event Viewer and forwards them to a third-party API to get geolocation data.
- A custom table (`FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL`) was created in Log Analytics Workspace on Microsoft Azure using the generated log file (`failed_rdp.log`). Custom fields were extracted from the table using a Kusto Query Language (KQL) query.
- A workbook was created in Microsoft Sentinel using KQL to query data from the `FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL` table to display global attackers (RDP login failure) on the world map according to physical location and magnitude (attack count).

**Source:** https://github.com/robsann/AzureSentinelSIEMAttackMap

## üìÅ Network Security with Snort (IDS/IPS)
- Snort network IDS mode configuration in Ubuntu Server.
- NMAP scan detection using Snort (NIDS):
    - NMAP Ping Scan, various TCP scans including SYN, Connect, NULL, FIN, and XMAS, as well as UDP Scans.
- Attack detection using Snort (NIDS):
    - SQL injection attacks using tools like WPSCan & WordPress and Burp Suite & SQLmap.
    - Backdoor attacks using Empire post-exploitation framework and Katana penetration test framework.
    - Rogue DHCP & Rogue Routing attacks.
