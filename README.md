# Hi, I'm Robson!
I've a keen interest in cyber security, with a specific focus on security operations encompassing network and endpoint security, traffic and log analysis, digital forensics, incident response, threat hunting, threat intelligence, malware analysis, web applications security, and vulnerability management. Leveraging my GitHub account, I curate homelabs to simulate diverse security operations scenarios. This platform serves as a repository for educational content covering system administration, network administration, and cyber security/security operations. Through these initiatives, I aim to contribute to the dissemination of cyber security knowledge.

<h1 align="center">Cyber Security Projects/Homelabs</h1>

I've been exploring some homelabs described in YouTube channels and blogs on topics such as threat hunting (XDR), endpoint security (EDR), monitoring (SIEM), and network security (IDS/IPS)

## Threat Hunting with Elastic Stack 8 (XDR)
- Configured in VirtualBox an Internal Network with:
    - DHCP Server
    - Ubuntu Server (Elastic Host)
    - Windows 10 (Victim)
- Configured Elastic Stack 8 on Ubuntu Server:
    - Elastic Stack: Elasticsearch, Kibana (UI), and Elastic Agent + Integrations.
    - Integrations: Fleet Server, System, Windows, and Elastic Defend.
- Simulated two malicious tests on the Victim machine:
    - EICAR Malware Test.
    - MITRE ATT&CK Test with Red Team Automation (RTA).

**Source:** https://github.com/robsann/ElasticStackLab
   
## Detection & Response with LimaCharlie (EDR)
- Configured in VirtualBox a NAT Network with:
    - DHCP Server and Host Gateway access.
    - Windows 11 (Target) with Windows Defender disabled, Sysmon and LimaCharlie sensor installed.
    - Ubuntu Server (Attack) with Sliver installed, a Command & Control (C2) framework by BishopFox.
- Generated in Sliver a C2 payload and executed the payload on the Target machine to start a Sliver C2 session on the Attack machine.
- Used the Sliver C2 session to perform two attacks on the Target machine:
    - LSASS access (credential-stealing attack).
    - Volume shadow copies deletion using vssadmin Windows utility (used in ransomware attacks).
- Detection and response rules were created in the LimaCharlie platform to detect the two previous attacks and take action. The rules were tested by repeating the attacks.

**Source:** https://github.com/robsann/LimaCharlieEDRTelemetry
   
## Attack Monitoring with Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)
- Microsoft Sentinel was used to monitor failed RDP login attempts from global attackers on an exposed Windows 10 virtual machine configured in Microsoft Azure.
- A custom log file (`failed_rdp.log`) was generated using a PowerShell script that extracts failed login events from Security Log on Event Viewer and forwards them to a third-party API to get geolocation data.
- A custom table (`FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL`) was created in Log Analytics Workspace on Microsoft Azure using the generated log file (`failed_rdp.log`). Custom fields were extracted from the table using a Kusto Query Language (KQL) query.
- A workbook was created in Microsoft Sentinel using KQL to query data from the `FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL` table to display global attackers (RDP login failure) on the world map according to physical location and magnitude (attack count).

**Source:** https://github.com/robsann/AzureSentinelSIEMAttackMap

## Network Security with Snort (IDS/IPS)
- Snort network IDS mode configuration in Ubuntu Server.
- NMAP scan detection using Snort (NIDS):
    - NMAP Ping Scan, various TCP scans including SYN, Connect, NULL, FIN, and XMAS, as well as UDP Scans.
- Attack detection using Snort (NIDS):
    - SQL injection attacks using tools like WPSCan & WordPress and Burp Suite & SQLmap.
    - Backdoor attacks using Empire post-exploitation framework and Katana penetration test framework.
    - Rogue DHCP & Rogue Routing attacks.
    - ICMP Redirect attack.

# OSI Model
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software.
