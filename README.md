# Hi, I'm Robson!
I have a keen interest in cyber security, with a focus on security operations including network and endpoint security, traffic and log analysis, digital forensics, incident response, threat hunting, threat intelligence, malware analysis, web applications security, and vulnerability management. Leveraging my GitHub account, I curate homelabs to simulate diverse security operations scenarios and content covering system administration, network administration, and cyber security and security operations topics.

<h1 align="center">Cyber Security Homelabs</h1>

I've been exploring some homelabs described in YouTube channels and blogs on topics such as threat hunting (XDR), endpoint security (EDR), monitoring (SIEM), and network security (IDS/IPS)

## üìÅ Threat Hunting with Elastic Stack 8 (XDR)
- Configured in VirtualBox an Internal Network with:
    - DHCP Server
    - Ubuntu Server (Elastic Host)
    - Windows 10 (Victim)
- Configured Elastic Stack 8 on Ubuntu Server:
    - Elastic Stack: Elasticsearch, Kibana (UI), and Elastic Agent + Integrations.
    - Integrations: Fleet Server, System, Windows, and Elastic Defend.
- Simulated two malicious tests on the Victim machine:
    - EICAR Malware Test.
    - MITRE ATT&CK Test with Red Team Automation (RTA).

**Source:** https://github.com/robsann/ElasticStackLab
   
## üìÅ Detection & Response with LimaCharlie (EDR)
- Configured in VirtualBox a NAT Network with:
    - DHCP Server and Host Gateway access.
    - Windows 11 (Target) with Windows Defender disabled, Sysmon and LimaCharlie sensor installed.
    - Ubuntu Server (Attack) with Sliver installed, a Command & Control (C2) framework by BishopFox.
- Generated in Sliver a C2 payload and executed the payload on the Target machine to start a Sliver C2 session on the Attack machine.
- Used the Sliver C2 session to perform two attacks on the Target machine:
    - LSASS access (credential-stealing attack).
    - Volume shadow copies deletion using vssadmin Windows utility (used in ransomware attacks).
- Detection and response rules were created in the LimaCharlie platform to detect the two previous attacks and take action. The rules were tested by repeating the attacks.

**Source:** https://github.com/robsann/LimaCharlieEDRTelemetry
   
## üìÅ Attack Monitoring with Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)
- Microsoft Sentinel was used to monitor failed RDP login attempts from global attackers on an exposed Windows 10 virtual machine configured in Microsoft Azure.
- A custom log file (`failed_rdp.log`) was generated using a PowerShell script that extracts failed login events from Security Log on Event Viewer and forwards them to a third-party API to get geolocation data.
- A custom table (`FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL`) was created in Log Analytics Workspace on Microsoft Azure using the generated log file (`failed_rdp.log`). Custom fields were extracted from the table using a Kusto Query Language (KQL) query.
- A workbook was created in Microsoft Sentinel using KQL to query data from the `FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL` table to display global attackers (RDP login failure) on the world map according to physical location and magnitude (attack count).

**Source:** https://github.com/robsann/AzureSentinelSIEMAttackMap

## üìÅ Network Security with Snort (IDS/IPS)
- Snort network IDS mode configuration in Ubuntu Server.
- NMAP scan detection using Snort (NIDS):
    - NMAP Ping Scan, various TCP scans including SYN, Connect, NULL, FIN, and XMAS, as well as UDP Scans.
- Attack detection using Snort (NIDS):
    - SQL injection attacks using tools like WPSCan & WordPress and Burp Suite & SQLmap.
    - Backdoor attacks using Empire post-exploitation framework and Katana penetration test framework.
    - Rogue DHCP & Rogue Routing attacks.
    - ICMP Redirect attack.

<h1 align="center"><code>SysAdmin Concepts</code></h1>

## üíæ Linux File System
The Linux File System is a hierarchical structure that organizes and stores files on a Linux system. It uses a tree-like directory structure, starting with the root directory ("/"), with directories and files arranged in a systematic manner to facilitate efficient file management and access.

<div align="left">
<img src='images/Linux_File_System.png' width="50%">
</div>
<br>

## üíæ Linux File Permissions
Linux File Permissions dictate the access level of users (owner, group, and others) to files and directories. They are represented by read, write, and execute permissions, providing control over file security and user interactions.

<div align="left">
<img src='images/linux_file_permissions.png'>
</div>
<br>

## üíæ Linux Useful Commands
Linux commands help users navigate the file system, interact with the files, and administer the entire system using the command line interface.

**Note:** Use the `man` command to display manual pages for other commands, providing detailed documentation and usage instructions (e.g., `man ls`).


<div align="center">
<img src='images/linux_commands.png'>
</div>
<br>

## üíæ Linux Useful Files
- **Configuration files (/etc/)** store system-wide settings, preferences, and configurations for various applications, facilitating centralized management.
- **System Info files (/proc/)** provide a virtual file system exposing kernel and process information, allowing dynamic access to real-time system details and parameters.
- **Log files (/var/log/)** store system and application logs, aiding in troubleshooting by capturing events, errors, and diagnostic information for analysis and monitoring.

<div align="left">
<img src='images/linux_files_and_logs.png' width="100%">
</div>
<br>

<h1 align="center"><code>Networking Concepts</code></h1>

## üíæ OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to describe how network communications work. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software.

<div align="center">
<img src='images/OSI_Model.png'>
</div>
<br>

## üíæ DHCP
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on IP networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client‚Äìserver architecture.

<div align="center">
<img src='images/DHCP.png'>
</div>
<br>

## üíæ DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a naming database that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) to machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., 93.184.216.34) used for device communication. If the website is not cached, the DNS resolver will query Root Servers, Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers, and Authoritative Nameservers to retrieve the IP address.
