# Cybersecurity Projects & Labs
## [Threat Hunting with Elastic Stack 8 (XDR)](https://github.com/robsann/ElasticStackLab)
- Configured in VirtualBox:
    - DHCP Server
    - Ubuntu Server (Elastic Host)
    - Windows 10 (Victim)
- Configured Elastic Stack 8 on Ubuntu Server:
    - Elastic Stack: Elasticsearch, Kibana (UI), and Integrations.
    - Integrations Fleet Server, Elastic Agent, System, Windows, and Elastic Defend.
    - Added Fleet Server (Ubuntu Server) and Agent (Windows 10) using Elastic Agent.
- Simulated tests:
    - EICAR Malware Test.
    - MITRE ATT&CK Test with Red Team Automation (RTA).

## [Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) Attack Map](https://github.com/robsann/AzureSentinelSIEMAttackMap)
- Configured an exposed Windows 10 VM in Microsoft Azure to monitor failed RDP login attempts from global attackers using Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM).
- Used a custom PowerShell script that extracts failed login events from Event Viewer Security Log, forwards them to a third-party API to get geolocation data, and generates a log file with geolocation and event data. 
- Created a custom table in Log Analytics Workspace on Azure using the previously generated log file and queried the table to extract custom fields using Kusto Query Language (KQL).
- Created a workbook in Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) using KQL to display global attack data (RDP login failure) on the world map according to physical location and magnitude (attack count).

## [LimaCharlie (EDR) Telemetry](https://github.com/robsann/LimaCharlieEDRTelemetry)
- Configured in VirtualBox:
    - Windows 11 (Target) with Virus & Threat Protection disabled, Sysmon and LimaCharlie (EDR) Sensor installed
    - Ubuntu Server (Attack) with Sliver installed, a Command & Control (C2) framework by BishopFox.
- Generated C2 payload on Attack Machine, executed the payload on Target Machine, and started C2 session on Attack Machine.
- Used C2 session to perform two attacks on Target Machine:
    - LSASS access (credentials stealing)
    - Shadow Copies deletion using vssadmin.exe (used in Ransomware attacks).
- Created Detection & Response Rules in LimaCharlie (EDR) to detect the two previous attacks using the telemetry generated and tested the rules by performing the attacks again.

## Pentesting & Network Security with Snort (IDS/IPS)
- Network IDS/IPS setup using Snort in Ubuntu.
- NMAP scan detection using Snort (NIDS):
    - Identify NMAP Ping Scan, TCP Scan, XMAS Scan, FIN Scan, NULL Scan, and UDP Scan.
- Attack detection using Snort (NIDS):
    - SQL injection attacks using WPSCan & Wordpress and Burp Suite & SQLmap.
    - Backdoor attacks using Empire and Katana.
    - Rogue DHCP & Rogue Routing attacks.
    - ICMP Redirect attack.
