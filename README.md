# Cybersecurity Projects
## [Azure Sentinel (SIEM) Attack Map](https://github.com/robsann/AzureSentinelSIEMAttackMap)
- Configured an exposed Windows 10 VM in Azure to monitor failed RDP login attempts from Global Attackers using Azure Sentinel (SIEM).
- Configured a Windows 10 VM with Firewall disabled and RDP (3389) port open and used a custom PowerShell script to extract metadata from Windows Event Viewer and forward it to a 3rd party API to get geolocation data.
- Configured a custom log in Log Analytics workspaces on Azure to ingest custom logs containing geographic information (latitude, longitude, state, and country) and extracted the fields using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to map geo data into Azure Sentinel.
- Configured an Azure Sentinel (SIEM) workbook to display global attack data (failed RDP login attempts) on the world map according to physical location and magnitude (count) of attacks.

## [LimaCharlie (EDR) Telemetry](https://github.com/robsann/LimaCharlieEDRTelemetry)
- Windows 11 (Target) with Virus & Threat Prodection disabled, Sysmon and LimaCharlie (EDR) Sensor installed.
- Ubuntu Server (Attack) with Sliver, a Command & Control (C2) framework by BishopFox.
- Generate C2 payload, execute payload from Target machine, and start C2 session.
- Create Detection & Response Rules in LimaCharlie (EDR) to detect:
    - LSASS access
    - Shadow copies deletion using vssadmin.exe

## Lab Pentesting & Network Security (IDS/IPS)
- Network IDS/IPS setup using Snort in Ubuntu.
- NMAP scan detection using Snort.
    - Identify NMAP Ping Scan, TCP Scan, XMAS Scan, FIN Scan, NULL Scan, and UDP Scan.
- Attack detection by SQLi using WPSCan & Wordpress and using Burp Suite & SQLmap.
- Attack detection by Backdoor using Empire and using Katana.
- Attack detection by Rogue DHCP & Rogue Routing.
- Attack detection by ICMP Redirect.
