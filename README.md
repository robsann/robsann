### Cybersecurity Projects
#### Azure Sentinel (SIEM) Attack Map
- Configured an exposed Windows 10 VM in Azure to monitor failed RDP login attempts from Global Attackers using Azure Sentinel (SIEM).
- Configured a Windows 10 VM with Firewall disabled and RDP (3389) port open and used a custom PowerShell script to extract metadata from Windows Event Viewer and forward it to a 3rd party API to get geolocation data.
- Configured a custom log in Log Analytics workspaces on Azure to ingest custom logs containing geographic information (latitude, longitude, state, and country) and extracted fields to map geo data into Azure Sentinel.
- Configured Azure Sentinel (SIEM) workbook to display global attack data (failed RDP login attempts) on the world map according to physical location and magnitude (count) of attacks.
