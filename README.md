# Hi, I'm Robson

I have extensive programming experience and a keen interest in Cyber Ssecurity, with a focus on security operations and data flow automation. I leverage my GitHub account to curate homelabs to simulate various security operations scenarios and test tools used in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Additionally, whenever possible, I try to create some small snippets of content covering topics in systems administration, network administration, and cybersecurity. My certificates can be found [here](https://github.com/robsann/robsann/blob/main/docs/certificates.md).

<h2 id="microsoft-sentinel">Attack Monitoring with Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)</h2>
</summary>
<span style="color:gray">

- Microsoft Sentinel was used to monitor failed RDP login attempts from global attackers on an exposed Windows 10 virtual machine configured in Microsoft Azure.
- A custom log file (`failed_rdp.log`) was generated using a PowerShell script that extracts failed login events from Security Log on Event Viewer and forwards them to a third-party API to get geolocation data.
- A custom table (`FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL`) was created in Log Analytics Workspace on Microsoft Azure using the generated log file (`failed_rdp.log`). Custom fields were extracted from the table using a Kusto Query Language (KQL) query.
- A workbook was created in Microsoft Sentinel using KQL to query data from the `FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL` table to display global attackers (RDP login failure) on the world map according to physical location and magnitude (attack count).

<summary>
<h2 id="sysadmin-concepts">SysAdmin Concepts</h2>
</summary>
<span style="color:gray">

### Linux File System

The Linux File System is a hierarchical structure that organizes and stores files on a Linux system. It uses a tree-like directory structure, starting with the root directory ("/"), with directories and files arranged systematically to facilitate efficient file management and access.

<div align="center">
<img src='images/linux_file_system.png' width="45%">
</div>
<br>

### Linux File Permissions

Linux File Permissions dictate the access level of users (owner, group, and others) to files and directories. They are represented by read, write, and execute permissions, providing control over file security and user interactions.

<div align="center">
<img src='images/linux_file_permissions.png' width="75%">
</div>
<br>

### Linux Useful Commands

Linux commands help users navigate the file system, interact with the files, and administer the entire system using the command line interface.

**Note:** Use the `man` command to display the manual page for other commands (e.g., `man ls`), providing detailed documentation and usage instructions, or use the `--help` option (e.g., `ls --help`) for a quick overview of the command options.

<div align="center">
<img src='images/linux_commands.png' width="75%">
</div>
<br>

### TCP vs UDP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented and reliable transport layer protocol, that ensures data integrity and ordered delivery. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless and lightweight transport layer protocol that sacrifices reliability for reduced latency, making it suitable for real-time applications where occasional data loss is acceptable.

### DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a naming database that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) to machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., 93.184.216.34) used for device communication. If the website is not cached, the DNS resolver will query Root Servers, Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers, and Authoritative Nameservers to retrieve the IP address.
